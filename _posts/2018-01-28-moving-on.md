All great things come to an end, and so it has with my role at Scout. After five years I have decided to take a job closer to home. Exciting new challenges and changes await, now only a short bike ride away!
<p>A special thanks to all the staff at Scout for the special memories and amazing experience.</p>
<p>Let's hope this next endeavour is as enjoyable!</p>
